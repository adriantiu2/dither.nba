            <p>In the 2017 postseason, Celtics guard Isaiah Thomas played through a hip injury that would eventually force him out of the league in 2020. In that 2017 postseason, he led the Celtics to the Eastern Conference Finals, risking his long term career for the franchise he grew to love. He played the first game of the playoffs after finding out his sister died in a car accident. Later that summer, Celtics General Manager Danny Ainge traded him to the Cavaliers after the analysis of his injury deemed him valueless.

            <p>In 2007, Greg Oden was selected first overall in the NBA draft by the Trail Blazers. Three separate surgeries for an ailing right knee would sideline him for the majority of his early career and in 2012 he was waived by the Blazers. In 2015 he departed to the Chinese Basketball Association and now works as an assistant coach at Ohio State.
